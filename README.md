# Tigerlang-ocaml
A hobby project, reading the book "Modern Compiler Implementation" by Andrew W. Appel and implementing its product language.

This is by no means good OCaml code (I'm new to FP, OCaml and Compilers), but nonetheless representing a working Tigerlang compiler. No software is bug-free, but this one is especially not well-tested, but I'll try to fix whatever edge-cases that I find are not working as expected. Other than that, my style of programming is very defensive and I think thoroughly explore the problem before and as I write the code, so I hope the extra time and effort prove its worth.
